# CIS-420-Project-SQL-code
This code was designed in a group of four to allow for a database to be connected to our website we were building for the University of Louisville SRC.
We wanted to make it easier for data to be stored, and allow members, employees, and management have access to the website.
These sql queries pull data that was entered by a user, and store it in a database that can be used for SQL queries.
This code was designed by me, and and a partner within the group to demonstrate our knowledge of Microsoft SQL management studio
